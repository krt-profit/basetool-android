# The backend's OpenAPI document, vendored

`openapi.json` is a **copy** of the main repository's
`backend/src/main/resources/api/openapi.json`, which that repo keeps in sync with its controllers
(`REQ-API-007`). Nothing in this repository edits it.

| Copied from commit | `131e1c6f7205e5e51e11daba35799c8bb95a63e3` (2026-08-20) — **PR krt-profit/basetool#1613, not yet on `main`** |
| Document | OpenAPI 3.1.0 · 397 paths · 403 schemas |

> The copy is ahead of the backend's `main` on purpose: it carries
> `GET /api/v1/users/me/memberships`, which the org-unit switcher calls and which lands with
> basetool#1613. **This repository must not release a build that calls it before that PR is
> merged and deployed** — the endpoint would 404 and the switcher would show nothing.
> The schemas are unchanged, so nothing generated from this copy depends on the new path.

## Refreshing it

```bash
cp ../basetool/backend/src/main/resources/api/openapi.json core/contract/src/main/openapi/openapi.json
./gradlew :core:contract:build
```

Then update the commit above, and **read the compiler output rather than skimming it**: a model
that stopped compiling is the pipeline doing its job. A field that vanished from the document is a
field this app was reading, and the fix is a conversation with the backend rather than a `?.` at
the call site — the operations the app consumes are frozen against exactly that (main repo
`REQ-API-009`, ADR-0136).

## When to refresh

**Together with the main repo's contract-set change that opens new endpoints to the app.** Each app
phase extends `REQ-API-009`'s enumerated set, the API vhost's allow-list and this copy; the three
are one decision seen from three sides. Refreshing this file on its own only imports schema churn
from endpoints the app cannot reach.

## What is not checked

Nothing verifies that this copy still matches the source. The build compiles against what is here,
so drift is caught the moment somebody refreshes it — and not before. Both repositories are public,
which makes an automated comparison reachable; it is recorded as open in `REQ-APP-API-005` rather
than implied by this file's existence.
